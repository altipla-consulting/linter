# linter

Opinionated linter for Go source code.

It is using [revive](https://github.com/mgechev/revive) underneath. We recommend using it directly instead of the internal customization on top of it you have in this repo.


## Install

```shell
go install github.com/altipla-consulting/linter@latest
```
